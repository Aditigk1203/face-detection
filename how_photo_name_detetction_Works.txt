ðŸ”¹ How the face storing script works

Ask for name

It prompts: Enter person's name:

That becomes the folder name where face images are saved.

Open camera feed

Uses OpenCV (cv2.VideoCapture(0)) to grab frames in real-time.

Detect faces

Converts each frame to grayscale.

Runs Haarcascade (OpenCVâ€™s built-in face detector).

For every face detected â†’ draws a rectangle.

Crop + Save face images

Takes the part of the frame where the face is.

Saves it as face_0.jpg, face_1.jpg, ... inside your personâ€™s folder.

Loop until enough images (50 by default) or you press q

Each new detection increments count.

When count >= 50, the loop stops automatically.

Otherwise, you can stop early by pressing q.
